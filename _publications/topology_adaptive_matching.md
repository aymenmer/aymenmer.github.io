*Figure: To match two meshes $\M$ and $\N$ with topological artefacts (see red boxes), we jointly optimise for a template $\T$, initialised as either $\M$ or $\N$, and its alignments $\tilde{\T}_{\M}$ and $\tilde{\T}_{\N}$ with $\M$ and $\N$ using a novel topology adaptive deformation model (see green box) under ARAP and bijective associations constraints.*
