I am currently a PhD student at Inria Grenoble in the [Morpheo Team](https://team.inria.fr/morpheo/). I work under the supervison of Dr. [Stefanie Whurer](https://swuhrer.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/) and Dr. [Edmond Boyer](https://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/people/Boyer/) on data driven geometry processing for human performance capture.
